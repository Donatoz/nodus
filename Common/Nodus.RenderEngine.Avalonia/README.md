# RenderEngine.Avalonia

This project provides a bridge between RenderEngine and Avalonia UI framework, as
well as example shaders and textures to test the minimal functionality.

> Note that the mentioned shaders are targeting OpenGL ES 3.0, meaning that
> an Avalonia application has to run using the appropriate rendering backend
> (e.g. Angle 2.0+)
